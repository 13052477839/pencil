# Pencil

A GUI prototyping tool for GNU/Linux, Windows & Mac.

This project was originally hosted on https://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/ &
was abandoned around 2013. This fork was started for new development on March
13th, 2015.

Much of this project is still unmaintained & could use some love.

## Build

Only building for GNU/Linux has been tested since forking.

```bash

cd build
./build linux
xulrunner Outputs/Linux/application.ini || firefox --app Outputs/Linux/application.ini

```

## License

This fork is released under GPLv2 like it's parent codebase.
